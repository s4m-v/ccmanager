# ccmanager

This is just a simple program to help manage different calcurse calendars.

calcurse-caldav is very buggy, so I plan to focus on the restoration of corrupted calendars.

## Features

Handles both offline and caldav calendars.

### Interfaces:
* CLI
* TUI

### Calendar Management:
* open
* remove
* list
* sync
* backup
* add
